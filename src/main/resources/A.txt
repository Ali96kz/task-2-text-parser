Java, the language and the platform, owes much of its fame and longevity to the libraries, frameworks and tools which together make
up its ecosystem. No other programming language has been able to match the support that a rich ecosystem like the JVM
    has achieved. It’s extremely important to understand how the ecosystem exists today, as well as its history. This way
we can extract trends and patterns to understand the direction in which we are heading. In fact, all ecosystems are living organisms. They
’re born, they grow and become established, live their lives and one day will
    be replaced by a better, more suitable technology that solves the problem better.
Of course the problems we deal with are changing too. Some ecosystems survive in care homes, refusing to pass
    away, like FORTRAN and COBOL.
